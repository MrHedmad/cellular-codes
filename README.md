# Hedmad's stranded code

All of my broken code.

### PythonCode
   Stuff in Python. Either some Python solutions to bioinformatics problems found in the book, or some notes on python and various experiments.
    
-> Project Euler
    - Some solutions to the problems of project euler (www.projecteuler.net), in dire need of optimization
  
### Rust

Small things written while dabbling in rust.

### RWorkSpace
   Stuff in R. Contains both the package LPack with some random functions made by me, my R tutorial (both in comment and in notebook form, the latter still under development) plus some other stuff.
