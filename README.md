# Cellular codes repository

All of my broken code.

-> PythonCode
    - Stuff in Python. Either some Python solutions to Bioinformatics problems found in the book, or some notes on python and various experiments.

-> RWorkSpace
    - Stuff in R. Contains both my package LPack with some random functions, my R tutorial (both in comment and in notebook form) plus some other stuff.
